Notes:
- Maybe make more holes to see through? Those are some
  cool bits in the old areas.
- Maybe make less linear also?
- So many huge places don't have a single room
  - Chocolate Bypass
  - Smoking
- The map in MC, we can try to abbreviate
  - It would be like OS:FE|FE:OS,RH,BW,CH,U1
  - We could fit a bunch with that but it's not expandible
- Wayfinding by NovaWay. Find Your Wayâ„¢

I want keys for every room:
- Is this possible?

Room types:
- Basic:
  - 1 bed
  - 1 respawn point

We should be able to get everywhere:
- Starting at the entrance
- Without going Outside
- Without going through Waterways (except for WW-x rooms)
